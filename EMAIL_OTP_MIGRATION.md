# Email OTP Migration Guide

## Overview

The Academic Deadline Tracker has been successfully migrated from **SMS OTP (Twilio)** to **Email OTP (Nodemailer)** for user registration verification. This change eliminates Twilio dependencies and provides a more reliable and cost-effective signup process.

## What Changed

### ‚úÖ **New Email OTP Flow**
1. User enters name, email, and password during signup
2. System sends a 6-digit OTP to the user's email address
3. User verifies OTP to complete registration
4. Account is created with email verification status

### ‚ùå **Removed SMS OTP Flow**
- Twilio SMS integration removed
- Phone number no longer required for registration
- All Twilio-related environment variables removed

## Technical Changes

### Backend Changes
1. **New Service**: `services/emailOtpService.js` - Handles email OTP generation and sending
2. **Updated API Endpoints**:
   - `/api/signup` - Now uses email instead of phone for OTP
   - `/api/verify-otp` - Verifies email OTP instead of SMS OTP
3. **Database Schema**: Added `emailOtp` and `emailVerified` fields to User model
4. **Session Management**: Uses `emailOtpData` instead of `otpData` in sessions

### Frontend Changes
1. **signup.js**: Updated to work with email OTP flow
2. **Form Validation**: Phone number validation removed
3. **UI Messages**: Updated to reference email instead of SMS

### Configuration Changes
1. **Environment Variables**:
   - ‚úÖ Kept: `EMAIL_USER`, `EMAIL_PASS`, `EMAIL_HOST`, `EMAIL_PORT`
   - ‚ùå Removed: `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`

2. **Docker/Jenkins**: Updated to only include email configuration

## Benefits of Email OTP

### üöÄ **Reliability**

- Works with any SMTP server (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
- Eliminates phone number formatting/validation problems

### üí∞ **Cost Effective**
- No Twilio SMS costs
- Uses existing email infrastructure
- Scales without additional per-message charges

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security**

### üåç **Global Compatibility**
- Works worldwide without phone number restrictions
- No carrier or regional SMS delivery issues
- Better user experience across different countries

## Email Configuration

### Gmail Setup (Recommended)
```env
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password-here
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
```

### App Password Setup
1. Go to Google Account settings ‚Üí Security
2. Enable 2-factor authentication
3. Generate App Password for "Mail"

- **Yahoo**: `smtp.mail.yahoo.com:587`
- **Custom SMTP**: Configure according to your provider

## Migration Steps (Already Completed)

1. ‚úÖ Created `emailOtpService.js` with Nodemailer integration
2. ‚úÖ Updated User model with email OTP fields
3. ‚úÖ Modified signup and verification endpoints
4. ‚úÖ Updated frontend JavaScript for email flow
5. ‚úÖ Removed Twilio dependencies from all configs
6. ‚úÖ Updated environment variable templates
7. ‚úÖ Modified Jenkins and Docker configurations

## Testing the New Flow

### Local Testing
1. Ensure email configuration is correct in `.env`
2. Start the application: `npm start`
3. Navigate to signup page
4. Enter name, email, and password
5. Check email for OTP code
6. Complete verification

### Production Testing
1. Deploy using Jenkins pipeline
2. Verify email delivery works in production environment
3. Test complete signup flow
4. Monitor logs for any email delivery issues

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending
- Verify `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS` are correct
- Check if 2FA is enabled and App Password is used
- Ensure IMAP is enabled in Gmail settings
- Check spam/junk folders

### OTP Verification Fails
- Ensure OTP is entered within 10 minutes
- Check for typos in the 6-digit code
- Verify email address matches exactly

### Session Issues
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Check if session store is configured properly
- Monitor server logs for session errors

## Simulation Mode

The email OTP service includes a simulation mode for development:
- Activates when email credentials are invalid/missing
- Displays OTP in server console logs
- Allows testing without real email sending
- Useful for local development and testing

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Email Templates**: Rich HTML email templates with better styling
2. **Resend Logic**: Enhanced resend functionality with progressive delays
3. **Email Verification**: Additional email verification for password resets
4. **Multi-language**: Support for multiple languages in email content
5. **Analytics**: Track email delivery rates and user engagement

### Monitoring
- Monitor email delivery success rates
- Track OTP verification completion rates
- Set up alerts for email service failures
- Log email sending metrics for analysis

## Support

For any issues with the email OTP implementation:
1. Check server logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify email service configuration
3. Test with different email providers if needed
4. Monitor email delivery status in production
